Ruben:
Character: RUBEN
Ruben likes to receive a lot of context.
Ending : Ruben is going to bring alcohol and just alcohol.
You hinted. You implied. You trusted the vibe to carry the message.
 Unfortunately, Ruben does not run on vibes.
 Without a clear request, he defaulted to the safest possible interpretation: “I’ll bring something just in case.”
What this says ab you:
 You often expect shared understanding and sometimes forget that not everyone is on the same wavelength.
 
var Denise = 
Character: DENISE
Denise likes to receive a lot of context; otherwise, she will ask a lot of questions.
Ending : Brought an impressive spread. Honestly, this could pass as catering.
You gave Denise plenty of context who’s coming and what was already covered.
 When expectations were clear, Denise filled in the gaps herself, generously.
What this says ab you :
You prefer clear, direct communication and assume people will respond best when expectations are explicit. */
